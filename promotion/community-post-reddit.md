## Follow-up Comments

If someone asks "Is this really free?":
> Yep, 100% free! I built this for my own workflow and decided to share it. No paid features, no ads, just free tools.

If someone asks about security:
> It's open source on GitHub, so you can check the code if you want. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages (static HTML/CSS/JS), and there's no data collection or account creation required.

If someone reports a bug:
> Thanks for reporting! Could you share which Revit version you're using and what error message you're seeing? I'll look into it.

If someone requests a feature:
> That's a great idea! I'll add it to the roadmap. Feel free to open an issue on GitHub if you want to track progress.
